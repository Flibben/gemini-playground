*The view that made me fall in love with morning runs.*

## The First Mile
I thought I would run a marathon on day one. **I was wrong.** I barely made it to the end of the street. But the fresh air felt different that morning.

### What I Learned
1. Pace yourself.
2. Listen to your body.
3. Enjoy the view.

Run your own race, and don't worry about the speed.
